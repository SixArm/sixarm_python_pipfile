## What is Python?

Python is an interpreted high-level programming language for general-purpose programming. ([wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)))


## What is Pipenv?

Pipenv is a package manager tool. It automatically creates and manages a virtualenv for your projects, as well as adds/removes packages from your Pipfile as you install/uninstall packages. It also generates the file `Pipfile.lock`, which is used to produce deterministic builds. ([site](https://github.com/pypa/pipenv))
